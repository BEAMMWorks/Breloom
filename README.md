## 🎒 About

**Breloom Git** is a shared collection of curated files — including sprite images, type icons, generation-based folders, and other visual assets — to support developers and fans building Pokémon-related tools and trackers.

These resources were originally compiled to support [NotéDex Notion](#want-more-notédex-notion), our premium all-in-one Pokémon trainer’s notebook built in Notion. We’ve open-sourced the core assets here so others can easily build their own Pokédex, apps, or tools.
